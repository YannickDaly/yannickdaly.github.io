Welcome to my blog!  This half of my site will serve as a more informal section, as I catalog my experiences with UX Design and perhaps unrelated topics in the future.

So, what is UX design?  I think I'll dedicate my first post on this blog to explaining that.

*UX design* is a fancy abbreviation for "user experience design".  This is a technical field that has truly gained traction in recent years since it highlights the importance of businesses _understanding_ their users and not simply releasing a product built in an echo chamber of the board room.  A crucial aspect of UX design is being able to interpret what it is exactly users want with the product or service being provided.  

"The Design of Everyday Things" by Don Norman, serves as an excellent high-level glance at how important user experience has been in the design of objects we interact with every single day. As an experiment, pay attention to your actions the next time you approach a door. Many of you reading this have probably come across the jarring situation of pulling a door that needs to be pushed and vice-versa. A door that carries _good_ design will not have you pondering whether to push or pull.  Its a simple example such as this that highlights the importance of user experience to our lives and the influence it can have on relationships between businesses and their customers.

User researchers and designers tap into what makes processes smoother or more convenient for the targeted audience which overall leaves that audience satisfied.

So the next time you open a door to enter an establishment or business; take a moment to appreciate or disparage its design, depending on your experience.
