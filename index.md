# About Me

Hi! My name is Yannick, a Front-End Web Developer and UX Designer. Understanding users and acting on the ebb and flow of their needs is what I enjoy, as hectic as that may be.

I truly love collaborating and building with creative and talented individuals, bringing simple concepts to reality.  

I've been involved in web development for 2 1/2 years with focus on building intuitive and simplistic user interface for web apps. I'm currently an IT Business Analyst at Assurant, Inc.

Check out my skills:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, UX, Bootstrap, Balsamiq, Axure, Adobe Premiere, Adobe Photoshop, Agile Methodology and Project Management
